                In this chapter, first a table of compliance checks is displayed, followed by a
                detailed examination of compliance issues for each component.
                For each of these components, two percentages are provided: one indicating the
                level of basic security in place (higher is better), and the other showing
                how well this compares to other scanned organizations in the sector (median).

                This table provides an overview of the basic security status of the known assets.
                Basic security in order. In principle, all values in this table should be checked off.
